# Catapult 2025 Hackathon

# SETUP
Server might already be running? If not, change fetch in nextjs-dashboard/app/generator/form.tsx 
from "https://catapult-b9bq.onrender.com/submit" to "https://localhost/submit" and run backend/src/server/py.
From there, npm start as a local host to open frontend. We're trying to host website on another place but ran out of
deployments. 

# GOAL
With this, you can input different statistics and goals about yourself and get recommended
exercises, protein intake, and vegetable intake. You can view training videos for your recommended
exercises as well as pictures of locations in the Purdue Corec to show you were to try them out.
Food products will be linked to the Wikipedia pages to allow for the viewing of nutritional information.
